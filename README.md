# Crossword Program

## Overview

Welcome to the Crossword Program! This C++ program is designed to assist users in creating and solving crosswords. The program provides a user-friendly interface for creating crossword puzzles, and solving puzzles.

## Features

- **Crossword Creation:**
  - Allows users to create crossword puzzles by inputting words and their corresponding clues.
  - Automatically generates a crossword grid based on the provided words.

- **Solver Functionality:**
  - Provides a solving feature to help users find solutions to crossword puzzles.

## Test Runs

The program has undergone extensive testing to ensure its correct functionality. Various test cases cover different scenarios, including crossword creation with varying word lengths and solving puzzles.

1. **Crossword Creation:**
   - User inputs words to create a crossword puzzle.
   - The program generates a crossword grid based on the provided words.

2. **Solver Functionality:**
   - User utilizes the solving feature to find solutions to the crossword puzzle.
   - The program displays the solutions for the crossword.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is located in the accompanying PDF file named `Barron-Jose-crossword1.pdf`. The document is structured to be read from left to right, providing a detailed explanation of the code, its functions, and the rationale behind design decisions.

The code for this program is organized into three main files:

- `crossword.h`: Header file containing declarations for crossword-related functions and classes.
- `crossword.cpp`: Implementation file containing the definitions of the functions and classes declared in `crossword.h`.
- `cw.cpp`: Main program file where the user interacts with the crossword program using vectors.
